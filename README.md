# Test for a simple, single-page content-based web app.

A test web app that displays content and provides a quiz.

The idea here is to create a simple web page with a few sections and a quiz system. At the end of the quiz, users have the option to generate a certificate of completion.

This is a test scaffold for future development. The project is built using React 18 without a build process. All components and content are defined in the main script tag of `index.html`. This file is the entry point of the webpage and can be served as normal or launched locally in a modern web browser.

## Demo Site

https://history-of-computing.netlify.app/

## Tooling

- HTML5
- CSS3 with Flexbox
- React 18 (No build tools version)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Responsive Design Principles

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/history-of-computing-webpage.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
   - No build process required
   - No dependencies to install
   - Works offline

## Usage

- Navigate through different eras using the top navigation tabs

## Development

This project uses React without a build process for simplicity and educational purposes. All components and content are defined in the main script tag of `index.html`.
